# etch-a-sketchTOP
This project is a fun, interactive sketch pad inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch! It was created to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and Flexbox layout techniques.

## Features
- Generates a 16x16 grid of square divs by default  
- Grid is dynamically created using JavaScript (not hard-coded in HTML!)  
- Uses Flexbox to display the grid in rows and columns  
- Responsive hover effect: draw on the grid by moving your mouse over the squares  
- A button at the top allows the user to generate a new grid (up to 100x100)  
- Prevents performance issues by limiting grid size to 100x100  
- All styles are linked through an external CSS file  

## How to Use
1. Hover your mouse over the grid to "draw".
2. Click the button at the top to change the grid size (max 100).
3. Refresh page to start over.
4. Enjoy your pixel art!

## Tech Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)  
- Vanilla JavaScript
