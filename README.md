# etch-a-sketchTOP
This project is a fun, interactive sketch pad inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch! It was created to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and Flexbox layout techniques.

## Features
- Generates a 16x16 grid of square divs by default  
- Grid is dynamically created using JavaScript (not hard-coded in HTML!) 
- Displays current grid dimensions 
- Uses Flexbox to display the grid in rows and columns  
- Responsive hover effect: draw on the grid by moving your mouse over the squares 
- Nine color buttons to choose from including one with increasing opacity greyscale
  shades on hover and a multicolor button that randomly switches between nine pastel colors with each hover
- Includes an eraser button
- Responsive color buttons change size and border when clicked
- A button above the grid allows the user to generate a new grid (up to 100x100
  squares)  
- Prevents performance issues by limiting grid size to 100x100 squares
- All styles are linked through an external CSS file  

## How to Use
1. Select a color.
2. Hover your mouse over the grid to "draw".
3. Click the button above the grid to change the grid size (max 100).
4. Refresh page to start over.
5. Enjoy creating your pixel art!

## Tech Used
